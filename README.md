# AIRE - Automated Inspection and Recognision Engine

## Abstract

In a modern digital society in which the use of mobile terminals is extended by virtually the entire population in most regions, protection of the privacy is a crucial issue. 

There may be a good number of situations in which a person, authorized or not, can be placed in the middle of our communications and know all about its content. Examples of this include not only malicious attackers, but also service providers and even government institutions. 

In our project, the objective is to demonstrate two facts. The first is how easily you can obtain relevant and identifiable information about an user of these technologies. We will be able to extract data about applications and services, about the device itself and even some of the main interests of the user. 

The second fact is that, despite the efforts of developers to protect the privacy of user information, it will still be posible to extract a certain amount of data once you obtain network traffic of the device. 

We developed a full system capable of extracting and analizing data from a previously obtained network traffic capture on a Wireless network (or any other mean) by a mobile device, displaying the results graphically and intuitively. It will detect and display used applications, visited web pages, accessed IP addresses and their location, web surfing thematics and other useful data. 

## Installation and usage instructions

You will find the instructions (in Spanish at the moment... sorry!) in a PDF file inside the project. English coming very soon!

## Disclaimer

As part of GPLv3, we will not be resopnsible of irresponsible usage of our project. You should ONLY use this for educational purposes. 

## The probe to obtain captures

You can find instructions and configuration files for a Raspberry Pi WiFi probe in this secondary project:
